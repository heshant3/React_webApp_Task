Assumptions and Trade-offs
Assumptions
The project uses React with functional components and hooks.

UI components are styled using CSS modules for better encapsulation.

The project assumes users have basic familiarity with JavaScript and React.

Trade-offs
Horizontal scrolling: Implemented using native scroll functionality for better performance across devices, trading off some customizability.

Component modularity: Simplified for this project but can be expanded for larger-scale applications.
