- **Simplicity**: The project focuses on clean design and usability. Advanced features like API integrations are not included in this version.
- **Responsiveness**: The UI is optimized for desktop and mobile views.
- **Dependencies**: Leveraged popular libraries like React for faster development but avoided heavy third-party integrations to keep it lightweight.
